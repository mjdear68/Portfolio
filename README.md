# Geospatial Remote Sensing Portfolio
## About
I am passionate about using remote sensing and geospatial analysis to help build a more just and sustainable world. In 2023-2024 I completed a research project while studying with the University of New England, Australia, in which I used a Landsat NDVI time series to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of vegetation in the Blue Mountains National Park, NSW. Based on this experience, I am now pursuing a career in remote sensing and geospatial analysis.
